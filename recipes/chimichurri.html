    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup Olive Oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup finely chopped parsley</li>
    <li>3-4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or minced</li>
    <li>2 small red chilies, or 1 red chili, deseeded and finely chopped (about 1 table spoon finely chopped chili)</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 level teaspoon coarse salt</li>
    <li>pepper, to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon)</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Allow to sit for 5-10 minutes to release all of the flavours into the oil before using. Ideally, let sit for more than 2 hours if time allows.</li>
    <li>Chimichurri can be prepared earlier than needed, and refrigerated for 24 hours, if needed.</li>
    <li>Use to baste meats (chicken or steak) while grilling or barbecuing. We don't use it as a maranade, but choose to baste our meats with chimichurri instead. However, you can use it as a maranade if you wish. Also, add a couple of tablespoons over your steak to serve.</li>
